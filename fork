git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/FORKED_REPO.git
cd FORKED_REPO
echo "change 1" >> test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "fix"

echo "change 2" >> test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "wip"

echo "change 3" >> test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "more stuff"

echo "change 4" >> test.txt
git add . && git commit -m "finally done"
git log --oneline
```

You'll see something like:
```
a1b2c3d finally done
e4f5g6h more stuff
i7j8k9l wip
m0n1o2p fix
q3r4s5t initial commit
git rebase -i HEAD~4
```

Your editor opens showing:
```
pick a1b2c3d fix
pick e4f5g6h wip
pick i7j8k9l more stuff
pick m0n1o2p finally done
```

**Change it to:**
```
pick a1b2c3d fix
squash e4f5g6h wip
squash i7j8k9l more stuff
squash m0n1o2p finally done
```

Save and close. A new editor opens for the combined commit message. Write a clean message like:
```
feat: implement initial test changes

- Added incremental updates to test.txt
- Consolidated four draft commits into one clean commit
git log --oneline
```

Now you'll see:
```
z9y8x7w feat: implement initial test changes
q3r4s5t initial commit
git push origin main --force
